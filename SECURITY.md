## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in S3 Smart Browser, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email** the security team at: devopsnskru@gmail.com
3. **Include** the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- We will investigate and respond within 7 days
- We will keep you updated on our progress
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Best Practices

#### For Users

- **Keep your application updated** to the latest version
- **Use strong AWS credentials** and rotate them regularly
- **Implement proper access controls** for your S3 buckets
- **Use HTTPS** in production environments
- **Monitor access logs** for suspicious activity
- **Use IAM roles** instead of access keys when possible

#### For Developers

- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Validate all inputs** from users
- **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information
- **Use security scanning tools** in your CI/CD pipeline
- **Keep dependencies updated** to avoid known vulnerabilities

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- ✅ **Presigned URLs** - Files are downloaded directly from S3, not through the application
- ✅ **Non-root container** - Application runs as non-privileged user
- ✅ **Security contexts** - Kubernetes security contexts configured
- ✅ **Input validation** - All user inputs are validated
- ✅ **Error handling** - Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- ✅ **HTTPS support** - SSL/TLS encryption support

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Authentication system** - User authentication and authorization
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] **Audit logging** - Comprehensive audit logs for security monitoring
- [ ] **CORS configuration** - Configurable CORS settings
- [ ] **Security headers** - Additional security headers
- [ ] **Vulnerability scanning** - Automated vulnerability scanning

## Security Considerations

### AWS Credentials

- **Never expose AWS credentials** in logs or error messages
- **Use IAM roles** when running in AWS (EC2, EKS, Lambda)
- **Rotate credentials regularly** and use temporary credentials when possible
- **Implement least privilege** - only grant necessary S3 permissions

### Network Security

- **Use HTTPS** in production environments
- **Implement proper firewall rules** to restrict access
- **Use VPN or private networks** for internal deployments
- **Monitor network traffic** for suspicious activity

### Container Security

- **Use minimal base images** to reduce attack surface
- **Scan container images** for vulnerabilities
- **Implement security contexts** in Kubernetes
- **Use non-root users** in containers

### Application Security

- **Validate all inputs** from users and external sources
- **Implement proper error handling** without information disclosure
- **Use secure coding practices** and follow Go security guidelines
- **Regular security audits** and code reviews

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is discovered and patched. We follow semantic versioning for security releases:

- **Patch releases** (1.0.x) - Security fixes and bug fixes
- **Minor releases** (1.x.0) - New features and security enhancements
- **Major releases** (x.0.0) - Breaking changes and major security updates

## Security Tools

### Recommended Security Tools

- **Docker Security Scanning** - Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- **Kubernetes Security Policies** - Implement Pod Security Standards
- **AWS Security Hub** - Monitor AWS security posture
- **S3 Access Logging** - Enable S3 access logging for audit trails
- **CloudTrail** - Monitor AWS API calls and changes

### Security Testing

- **Static Analysis** - Use tools like `gosec` for Go security analysis
- **Dependency Scanning** - Use `go list -m all` to check for vulnerable dependencies
- **Container Scanning** - Use tools like Trivy or Clair
- **Penetration Testing** - Regular penetration testing of deployments
